## Introduction
This is a python based image retrieval model which makes use of deep learning image caption generator. It uses a merge model comprising of <b> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) </b> and a <b> Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) </b>. The dataset used here is <b> Flickr8K dataset</b>. You can request the dataset [here](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398). 

## Features
This model can be used both via <b>GUI</b> and <b>command line</b>. In both of these models image can be retrieved by-
* A description of image you want to retrieve
* An image whose semantically image you want to retrieve.

<b>Note-</b> The model performs well when text and images are semantically similar to the images in the dataset.
